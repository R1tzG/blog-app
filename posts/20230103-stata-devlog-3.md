title: 'Stata Devlog 3: Geotagged posts and Firebase email authentication'
date: '2022-12-30'

The app is starting to take shape! Users can now create accounts using and email and password, and set a username. Once signed in, there is functionality to create posts, which get geotagged with the users latitude and longitude coordinates. These posts are sent to the Firestore database, where all posts are saved with a username, post content, and location. The home feed updates with new posts when the user pulls down to refresh, and posts currently display the username and post text. The repository for the code is finally public, and can be accessed here: https://github.com/R1tzG/StataApp.

Next steps for the app are to mark all of the posts on the map in the search page, and make tags so that users can hide their location when creating a post, and instead say that they are at home, work, etc.
