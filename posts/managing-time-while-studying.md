As a student in high school, I definitely feel the pressure of balancing my time between schoolwork, extracurriculars, and other obligations. I know many friends who regularly stay up until midnight or 1 am finishing up homework and studying for tests. It's definitely not healthy to do this, and I've found that it's much better to manage your time and get things done early. Back in my freshman year, I was staying up late just to get my homework done. Studying for tests while you are tired leads to less retention of information, and poorer results. Spending less time, during which you are completely focused, is overall much better for you grades and your health. Here are some tips that I've found helpful in managing my time while studying.

1. Remove all distractions

Distractions such as social media, video games, and other things that you enjoy doing can be very tempting when you are studying. When tempted by these things, a job that should take 30 minutes can easily take 2 hours. To avoid this, I recommend removing all distractions from your study area. This can be done by turning off your phone, closing your browser, and putting away any other things that you enjoy doing. This will help you focus on your work, and get it done faster. A lot of people like to listen to music while they study, but I personally find that it can be distracting. If you do listen to music, make sure it's not too loud, and that it's not distracting. A genre like Lo-Fi, or classical music is good for studying, as it can stay in the background, allowing you to focus on your work.

2. Take breaks

It's never a good idea to work for hours on end without taking a break. When you take a break, you can get up and stretch, or do something else for a few minutes. This will help you stay focused and productive. However, don't take breaks too frequently, as it takes time to get back into the groove of things. I've found that it takes around 30 minutes to get in the zone for studying, so plan accordingly. A good way to take breaks is to plan them around times you need to do something else. For example, if you need to get lunch, you can take a break then, and use that time to get food and relax. While you are taking a break, do not do anything that is related to your work. This will reduce stress, and help you focus when you get back to work. If you're studying for a test, it's a good idea to keep thinking about the material in the back of your mind, but don't actively study. This will help you remember the material better, and you will be able to get back to work faster.  

3. Use a planner

I like to use an online planner to keep track of my assignments and upcoming tests. This helps me stay organized, and know what I need to do. I recommend using a planner that you can access on your phone, as it's much more convenient. I use Notion, a free online tool that allows great customisability and organization. I have my planner set up with a calender on the home page, along with a Trello-esque board for my assignments. I also have a page for each class, with a list of assignments and tests. Even though Google Classroom is great at showing what assignments are due, I like to keep my planner open at all times so that I am aware of what needs to be done.

Overall, I've found that managing my time while studying has helped me get better grades, and stay healthy. I am able to consistently sleep before 10pm, which allows me to get a good amount of sleep, and leave me feeling refreshed and energized the next day. I hope that these tips will help you manage your time while studying, and get better grades.
