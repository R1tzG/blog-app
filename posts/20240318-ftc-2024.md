This weekend, we participated in the FTC NJ State Championship, marking the end of our 2023-2024 robotics season.

After last year, we knew that we had a lot of potential. We had seen what makes a competitive team, and what we would need to do to replicate that for ourselves. Our new team, 23650, quickly became a force to be reckoned with in New Jersey. We established ourselves, building relationships with local and international teams, sponsors, and our community. We hit our fair share of roadblocks this season. The robot broke (many times), we had to redesign countless mechanisms, and we were always working against the clock when getting ready for competitions. But we prevailed. The team was incredibly dedicated and I couldn't be more grateful for their tireless commitment. 

After winning our regional championship (and the 2nd place Inspire award), we were champions of the Parkway divison at the state championship, and we ended as state finalists after 2 closely contested finals matches. 

I have learned a lot this year, and I hope to share with you some ideas on what allowed us to succeed this year. Even if you don't participate in the FTC competition, I believe you can take something away from these points.
