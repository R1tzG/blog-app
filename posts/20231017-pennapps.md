I know it's a bit late, but here is my post for PennApps XXIV, my first ever hackathon. As a high schooler, it is actually quite hard to find collegiate hackathons that I am eligible for. PennApps was a great opportunity to experience an in-person hackathon, as it was only a short drive away. Me and my [friend](https://justanotherinternetguy.neocities.org/) signed up as a team of two, ready to have a good time and expand our coding horizons.
