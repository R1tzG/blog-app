This year, a group of students at my school decided to organize hackMHS, a 24-hour high school hackathon run completely by Millburn High School. I was one of the organizers this year, and I had a great time helping to build the website for the hackathon [hackMHS](https://hackmhs.com/). The day of the hackathon was really fun. As an organizer, I was able to walk around and see all of the amazing projects that people were working on, and offer my help and guidance whenever I was asked. Overall, I had a great time, and I hope to participate in more hackathons.
