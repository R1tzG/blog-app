title: 'My thoughts on the 2023 FTC robotics season'

I have been involved in competitive robotics for a while now, starting with FLL at a young age and continuing on to VEX. This year, my school reformed our FTC team (8405 Millburn Robotics), after a 3 year hiatus. Out of our 15 members, 14 were new to the competition. However, most of our members had past robotics experience, which we were able to translate over to the new competition. 

In the middle of September, our coach proposed the idea that we reform the FTC team. It was destined be a great oppurtunity for our team to be competitive, and get real competition experience. (This is coming from a year of experimentation with VEX AI, check out my projects for more info).
