Wikipedia is an incredible repository of information, completely free to access for anyone with an internet connection. The website's dedicated community of editors is constantly revising and adding to the already catalog of articles. As someone who uses the internet, and Wikipedia, regularly, I have always wanted to contribute to the website, but have often found myself overwhelmed with its sheer size. Anticipating this hurdle, Wikipedia has an extensive guide to getting started editing. I followed the basic tutorial, which outlined the basics of editing and writing articles. After that, I was redirected to the Task Center, a useful page for contributors which directs you to articles that need edits. I was able to quickly write my first edit and publish it. Overall, the process is really easy, and I hope that regularly editing Wikipedia pages will increase my general knowledge and have a positive impact on the site.
