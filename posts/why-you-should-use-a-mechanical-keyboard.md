For many people, including me, everything I do revolves around my desk. More specifically, everything productive that I do is done on my computer. Becuase of this, the way I communicate with my computer is really important to me. For most modern computers, the keyboard is the main source of communication.
Since the start of computing, keyboards have typically been mechanical, meaning that they have dedicated switches for each key, which can have a different feel based on the type of switch. More recently, cheaper keyboards, and most laptop keyboards, use membrane keys. These are generally not as fun to use, and do not last as long as mechanical keyboards.
