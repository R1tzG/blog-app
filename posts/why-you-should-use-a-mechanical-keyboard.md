For many people, including me, everything I do revolves around my desk. More specifically, everything productive that I do is done on my computer. Becuase of this, the way I communicate with my computer is really important to me. For most modern computers, the keyboard is the main source of communication.
Since the start of computing, keyboards have typically been mechanical, meaning that they have dedicated switches for each key, which can have a different feel based on the type of switch. More recently, cheaper keyboards, and most laptop keyboards, use membrane keys. These are generally not as fun to use, and do not last as long as mechanical keyboards. 

There are three main types of switches: clicky, tactile, and linear. Most manufacturers label them with different colors, such as blue switches for clicky, brown for tactile, and red for linear. Other companies label their own switches differently. For more information about the different types of switches, do a quick google search, however the best way to differentiate is by testing each type of switch out for yourself.
