One of my biggest commitments and hobbies is the FTC (First Tech Challenge) team at my high school, Millburn Robotics 8405. This is my first year doing FTC, having participated in VEX AI the previous year. After half a year on the team, I have learnt a lot about programming and building. I wanted to share the knowledge I have gained by being on the team, and therefore created the website CodeFTC, which details important skills and topics to focus on when programming for FTC.
